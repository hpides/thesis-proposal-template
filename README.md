## Writing a Bachelor/Master Thesis at the Data Engineering Systems Group

This is the proposal template for writing a thesis at our group.
It is a very basic template that tries not to restrict you but lets you focus on writing.
Here is just a short list of things that you need to do:

### How to Use the Template
The template consists of the main `thesis.tex` file, a folder for the individual sections, and a folder for the images that you use.
It contains only very basic packages, so it should probably work with most Latex distributions and Overleaf.

In the `thesis.tex` file, you can set a few variables at the beginning of the file that then fill your cover page.

You can always find the newest version of this template in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hpides/thesis-proposal-template).
